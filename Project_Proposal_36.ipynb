    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "- Background Information:\n",
    "    - University rankings are one of the first aspects viewed when students, their families or employers look into a prospective education or employee. These rankings are valued by many people including the university itself as through these filters and discoveries flaws, biases, or interesting variables can be found within the data. By diving deeper into how the female student ratio in universities around the world influence the school's ranking, more informed decisions can be made by prospective students of their choice of a post-secondary school, students can expect the kind of environment they will be entering and education they will be receiving. \n",
    "- Predictive Question:\n",
    "    - Can global university ranking be predicted using the ratio of female students within the student body?\n",
    "- Data Set:\n",
    "    - The data set we have selected to use for this study is the World University Rankings 2023 data set published on Kaggle by Syed Ali Taqi in collaboration with Abdullah Sajid and Muhammad Jawad Awan. This set includes university rankings from across 104 countries which includes 1,799 indivdual universities. Original variables include:\n",
    "- Name of university\n",
    "- Location\n",
    "- Number of students\n",
    "- Number of students per staff\n",
    "- International student percentage\n",
    "- Female to male ratio (out of 100 count)\n",
    "As well as:\n",
